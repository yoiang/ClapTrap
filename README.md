ClapTrap simply takes a photo whenever it picks up a loud enough noise. Currently iOS only. 

Perfect for doing [this](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/compound-eye/2012/03/12/transform-your-iphone-into-a-microscope-just-add-water/).

Todo:
* automatically adjust required volume to weed out environment's volume and unintentional snaps
* better indication that a photo was taken
